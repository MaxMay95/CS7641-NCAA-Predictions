The goal is to cluster 64 teams in their respective seeds based on these 14 normalized features.
2.image
A 3D visualization for one year shows that they are not easy to distinguish by means of only 3 prinicipal components.
3.image
This is the same for all years from 2010-2018.
4.image
We need 9 out of 14 features to get a retained variance of 95.1%
5.image
Using euclidean distance and average linkage, we get approximately evenly sized clusters in the dendrogram.
6.image
The clusters were evaluted with three different measures and all show a decrease for finer clustering as expected. We reach a purity of 31% for 8 clusters.

7.image
This is a 3D visualization for qualified vs non-qualified teams with all teams from each year not only the 64 qualified ones.
8.image
We can see that in this case much more variance is contained in the first element, but stil 9 out of 14 are needed for 96.2% variance.

9.table
The clustering is not really good as both clusters are assigned to the same ground truth. We need better/more features or more data for better results. Furhtermore there are less qualified than non-qualfied points in the data set.
