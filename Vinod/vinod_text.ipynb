    "A fully connected neural network consists of a series of fully connected layers. Each layer has an input and an output dimension. An activation function is used to introduce non-linearity in each layer. The strength of every connection between layers is determined by it's respective weight which is the learnable parameter in the network. \n",

    "We used standard full connected neural network with two layers. The train accuracy was 1.0 and test accuracy was 0.75. The accuracies clearly indicate overfitting. \n",
